# **Research Paper Summarization Tool**  

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that uses **OpenAI's ChatGPT API** to **summarize research papers** uploaded as PDF files. It extracts text from PDFs, processes the content, and generates concise and meaningful summaries, making it easier for researchers and students to quickly grasp the main ideas of lengthy papers.

---

## **Features**
- **Upload PDF Files**: Users can upload research papers in PDF format.  
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses **ChatGPT** to generate summaries of the text extracted from the uploaded files.  
- **Simple Web Interface**: Built with Flask for easy interaction.  
- **Secure API Key Management**: Stores API keys securely using environment variables.  
- **File Handling**: Saves uploaded files in a designated folder (`uploads/`) for processing.  
- **Error Handling**: Handles unsupported file formats and missing uploads gracefully.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.7+** - Core programming language  
- **Flask** - Web framework for Python  
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 API** - For generating AI-powered summaries  
- **pdfminer.six** - Library for extracting text from PDFs  
- **dotenv** - For managing environment variables securely  

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiteshChakma/research-paper-summarizer.git
cd research-paper-summarizer
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:  
- **Windows**:  
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Linux/Mac**:  
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **4. Add OpenAI API Key**
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
2. Add your API key in the file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Replace **`your-openai-api-key`** with your actual API key from OpenAI.

---

### **5. Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

Open the web browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

### **6. Upload and Summarize**
1. Upload a **PDF research paper**.  
2. The tool extracts the text and generates a **summary** using ChatGPT.  

---

## **Usage Instructions**
- **Input**: Upload any **PDF file** containing research papers, articles, or reports.  
- **Output**: Get a concise **summary** of the uploaded document.  
- **Restrictions**: Text extracted from the PDF is limited to 4000 characters due to token size limits.  

---

## **Customization Options**
- **Long Documents**: Implement chunking logic to split and process larger files in smaller parts.  
- **Multi-Page Summaries**: Extend the tool to generate summaries section-wise (abstract, methods, etc.).  
- **Deployment**: Deploy on cloud platforms like **Heroku** or **Vercel** for online access.  
- **UI Enhancements**: Use **Bootstrap** or other frameworks for better styling.  

---

## **Dependencies**
All dependencies are listed in **requirements.txt**.  
To install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Error Handling**
- **File Format**: Rejects unsupported formats and displays an error message.  
- **Large Files**: Ensures proper handling of token size limits by truncating or splitting text.  
- **Missing Uploads**: Prevents crashes by validating user input before processing.  

---

## **Security**
- **Environment Variables**: API keys are stored in `.env` files and excluded from Git.  
- **File Validation**: Only processes `.pdf` files to prevent malicious uploads.  

---

## **Sample Output**
### **Input**:  
A PDF file titled *"AI and Machine Learning Trends in 2024"*.  

### **Output**:  
*"This paper discusses key trends in AI and machine learning, including advancements in natural language processing, ethical considerations, and their applications in healthcare and education. It emphasizes the need for fairness and transparency in AI models and highlights future research areas..."*

## **Known Issues**
1. **Token Limitations**: ChatGPT has a character/token limit. Very large files may need pre-processing.  
2. **Complex Formatting**: Some PDFs with images or tables may not extract text correctly.
